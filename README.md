# Data Science Journey - Muhammad Mehdi

Welcome to my Data Science learning and research repository.  
This repo tracks my progress through foundational concepts, core machine learning, deep learning, and real-world applications, culminating in my master's research project.

## Repository Structure

- `01_Foundations/`  
  Python basics, data cleaning, SQL, statistics, and math for machine learning.

- `02_Core_ML_Research/`  
  Machine learning fundamentals, regression, classification, clustering, time series, and research methods.

- `03_Deep_Learning/`  
  Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, GANs, transfer learning, and deployment.

- `04_Real_World_DS/`  
  Big data, cloud computing, data engineering, NLP, computer vision, forecasting, business cases, and enterprise tools.

- `05_Research_Project/`  
  Literature review, experiments, data sets, notebooks, and paper drafts.

- `projects/`  
  Hands-on projects and implementations.

- `resources/`  
  Books, courses, papers, and tools I use for study and research.

## How to Use

Explore folders by topics or jump to `05_Research_Project` for my thesis work.  
I will update this repo regularly as I learn and research.
